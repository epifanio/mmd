== Abstract

MET Norway Metadata Format (MMD) is an XML metadata format for storing
information about scientific datasets. MMD is made to document datasets in
order to make them findable. In this it supports information elements of
Findable, Accessible, and Reusable from the FAIR guiding principles.
Through the web services identified in MMD and the encoding of datasets
according to the preferred format NetCDF-CF, it also supports the
Interoperable aspect.  The specification is strongly linked to discovery
metadata standards like ISO19115 and GCMD DIF, but it also extends these
as it contains configuration metadata specific for the handling of the
datasets at the host data centre.
